# Bike Sharing in Des Moines, Iowa

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to creaate a proposal for bringing bike rentals to Des Moines, Iowa using Tableau.

## Results
The following visualizations were created for the proposal and have notes below each of them.

![Starting Location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwrhodes/bikesharing/main/resources/Starting_locations.png 'Starting Locations')
The above visualization shows the locations of where bikes are checked out. The circle size and color correspond to the number of bikes checked out. These results show a higher amount of bike checkouts occuring in lower to mid Manhattan. 

![Checkout Times by Users and Genders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwrhodes/bikesharing/main/resources/checkouttimes_by_users_genders.png 'Checkout Times by Users and Genders')
These two visualizations show the length of time for each bike rental as well as the number of rentals. The upper graph shows the total for all Genders, showing that the vast majority of rentals are less than 30 minutes. The lower visualization breaks down rental times by Gender. This shows that males are a much larger portion of the bike rentals, but the rental times are fairly equivalent between all Genders.

![Customers by Type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwrhodes/bikesharing/main/resources/customers_by_type.png 'Customers by Type')
This visualization uses a pie chart to show the proportion of each User Type. This shows that over 80% of customers are Subscribers.

![Trips by Gender Heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwrhodes/bikesharing/main/resources/trips_by_gender1.png 'Trips by Gender Heatmap')
Here a heatmap has been used to show the concentration of trips by different hours of the day over a week. It is also grouped by Gender. Male and Female usage appears to occur most from 7-9AM and 4-8PM on weekdays, probably coinciding with daily work commutes. 

![Trips by User and Gender Type Heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwrhodes/bikesharing/main/resources/trips_by_usertype_gender1.png 'Trips by User and Gender Type Heatmap')
This visualization also uses a heatmap, but breaksdown usage by User Type and Gender throughout the week. Here we can see Male Subscribers have a much higher concentration compared to the others.

![Trips by Weekday Heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwrhodes/bikesharing/main/resources/trips_by_weekday1.png 'Trips by Weekday Heatmap')
